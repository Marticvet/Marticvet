**`Junior Software Developer`**

I'm Software Developer and I'm building my version of the digital world one step at a time. My main and biggest project Tire-Shop is built from the ground up, from planning, designing and the database all the way to solving real-life problems with code. When I have unsolvable problem while I'm coding, I always come up with strange solution, which most of the times is working from the first time. This approach leads me even in the real life.

 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª Martin's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
    I started my coding journey in October 2020. I choose to learn one of the most popular programming language JavaScript. My first impressions were that the programming itself is quite interessting and something that give you the ability to do whatever you want. I definetely fell in love with JavaScript and his syntax. In first couple month sadly I've couldn't actively learing programming, because my job at this time and my German B2 course. One sunny day after a few hard month with almost not enough time for learning programming, I decided to stop learning the programming until my German B2 exam is done, which was in late September 2021. A few days later after this exam, one year later after my first steps in the world of programming, I started again avtively to learning programming and I have been even more motivated than before to learn JavaScript and dive deeply in Tech industry. I spent every single day and free time for learning and never regretted it. In March 2022 I had already good knowlege and I made a few projects with vanilla JavaScript toghether with PageJs, which basicly is DOM router and that was my first steps in Single Page Applications. I really liked the ability of Front-end Programming and I decided that maybe the smartest move in my journey is to start learning ReactJs. In April 2022 firstly I learned the fundamentals of React and once I felt enough confident in my knowlege, I made my first React project, which was done a week later. I wasn't enough familiar with basics of HTML and CSS. For this reason I used to the use the provided materials like HTML, CSS, Pictures and server from my academy. At this time I already thought what to do for my personal portfolio and I decided to start first with personal API and database. For database I choose firstly to learn MySQL and after that to fill the database with all information, which I needed for my React App. Once after it was done, I decided to choose for my Back-end app NodeJs with his ExpressJS framework, because I was enough familiar with JavaScript. Once after my Express app was done, one friend of mine and huge part of the time personal trainer told me that I can use SaaS for styling my Frond-end app. This decicion took me again back to learning process. Maybe after let's say two weeeks of learning SaaS, I started to feel myself good enough finally to start my first and biggest Single Page Application: Tire-Shop. (You can find more information about it in my github profile.) This project took me exactly 3 months. I had a few feeks off from programming, because I really grinded so hard in past months and I didn't want to burn out. Let's say in last 10-15% of the building the project, I decided to make my Express app to being more structured and I added users with proper user's authentication. I cannot say that this is the best, but for my knowlege at this time I'm quite happy with it. And finally at this point I could say the my React app is probably 100% done. I's hosting my ExpressJs and React apps on clouds for the purpose of easy access and usage from everyone. I'm thinking now to start learning Typescript, Node.js + TypeScript, and Typeorm. For conclusion I want say - Hello, world of Front-end developent. I'm ready for you.
